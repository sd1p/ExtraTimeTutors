      <p className="content">
        For the solution challenge hackathon, this tool was created. This tool's
        issue statement was "quality education." With the help of technologies
        like NLP for modelling, Flask for building the backend, React for
        building the tool's front end, and Flutter for building the tool's
        mobile app, we created a tool based on the issue statement. This
        programme may be used to create multiple choice questions from lecture
        videos found on YouTube, making it simpler for students to get
        assessment assignments for their evaluation. The tool may be used to sum
        up a lecture that has been published on YouTube. If accessible, the
        technology may also be used to generate questions straight from text.

      <h3 className="heading">The Team</h3>
      <p className="content">
        In order to make this tool a reality, our team of four dedicated
        individuals contributed their all. Our team is made up of Utsav Verma,
        our team leader, who helped construct the mobile app for our tool so
        that it may reach a larger audience through smartphone, Shivam Kumar,
        who produced the NLP model that powers the tool, Sudip Kumar Mandal, who
        developed the back end of the web app and helped in implementing the NLP
        model and also assisted in designing the front end of the app, and
        Nishant Emmanuel Ekka, who created the UI and front end of the app.
        Together, they both designed a user-friendly UI so that anybody can
        quickly browse the tool and use it to its fullest extent
